There are tons of on-line resources for neuroimaging data analysis so the
following list is not meant to be exhaustive. There are also similar lists here
and there that might partly overlap with this one, so here is a list of lists.

### Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse

The most obvious place where everything is centralized is the
[Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse](https://www.nitrc.org/).
Many tools, atlases, courses are there but if your favorite isn't make sure to
add it.

### Lab guides and lab wikis

If your lab does not have a lab guide/wiki, it is well worth the time to make
one. Lab wikis can save a lot of time for newcomers to get set up and started
(rather than reinvent the wheel or take time from other lab members), while lab
guides will also help PIs, PhD students and post-docs know what to expect from
each others and to promote a
[healthier lab culture](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05142-9).
[Mariam Aly](https://twitter.com/mariam_s_aly) explains that well
[here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06167-w).

If you lab does not have a guide and/or wiki here is a
[list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kn4A0nR4loUOSDn9Qysd3MqFJ9cGU91dCDM6x9aga-8/edit#gid=0)
you can use to create your own. But I suggest that you go beyond a copy-paste as
the ones you find in there might not be tailored to your lab's needs.

And here are some neuroimaging oriented lab wikis:

- [Mariam Aly's](https://twitter.com/mariam_s_aly) lab wiki is
  [there](https://osf.io/kgd9b/wiki/home/).
- [Jonathan Peelle](@jpeelle) has a great
  [list of resources](http://jonathanpeelle.net/mri-resources-for-beginners) for
  beginners.
- Check the [wiki](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/CbuImaging) from the
  CBU in Cambridge.
- The one from [Tor Wager's](https://twitter.com/torwager)
  [lab](https://canlabweb.colorado.edu/wiki/doku.php/help/fmri_tools_documentation)
- Michael Beauchamp's lab
  [wiki](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Beauchamp:Lab_Notebook)
- Chris Rorden's Neuropsychology Lab
  [wiki](https://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/crnl/tools)
- The [Kording](https://twitter.com/KordingLab) lab and Kendrick Kay's labs are
  more computational oriented and so check
  [them](http://kordinglab.com/resources/)
  [out](http://cvnlab.net/resources.html) if this is what you do.
