# online_neuroimaging_resources

A laundry list of [online resources](.Main.md) for MRI, fMRI, EEG, MEG...


## How to contribute
Feel free to add your own resource or any material you have found useful. Send me a pull request to this repository or raise an issue. Or if you don't know how to do that you can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/RemiGau.)

You can check the **looking for** section right below to see what sections of this document need populating. I have also tried to flag with `???` in the table of content and in the main document the areas where I am pretty sure I have missed existing gems.


## Looking for
*   Material on the BOLD signal: origin and biophysics
*   Material on preprocessing, denoising
*   Material on statistical inference in neuroimaging: peak, voxel, cluster based
*   Material on multiple comparison correction in neuroimaging
*   Material on DTI, ASL
*   Material on connectivity: PPI, DCM, granger causality
*   Material on licenses
