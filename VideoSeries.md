If you run out of things to binge on Netflix, Youtube has some useful channels
if you want to learn more about fMRI data analysis. I also list here other
repository of MRI related videos.

### Mumford brainstats

Jeanette Mumford has a fantastic series of videos on neuroimaging analysis on
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7gF0zm35FwrFpDND6DWeA). The channel
also has [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mumfordbrainstats/)
(as well as a [tumblr](http://mumfordbrainstats.tumblr.com/) and
[twitter account](https://twitter.com/mumbrainstats)) if you have questions.
